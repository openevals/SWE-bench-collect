    return f"""You are a professional software engineer helping to annotate a dataset. 

üëã Hello! 

We have a dataset of GitHub issues from various open-source Python repositories. Each issue comes with a PR that successfully solves the issue described. Each PR consists of 2 parts: (1) code that resolves the issue (2) changes to the test files of the repository, which check whether the issue has been resolved. 

We intend to use samples in this dataset as a benchmark for coding ability: For each sample, we give an engineer the issue text and ask them to write code to resolve the issue (without revealing the solution from the original PR). Then, we apply the test files from the original PR to their code and run the tests to check whether their solution passes. 

Importantly, this setup assumes that: 

- The issue description is sufficiently well-specified to understand what the problem is, and what the correct solution should look like. 
- The tests are correctly scoped to the issue i.e. they correctly test for a solution exactly as described in the issue description, and do not test any other unrelated functionality. 

In this task, you will help to check those assumptions and identify which issue + test samples are suitable for use in our benchmark.

You are now considering an issue from the {repo} repository

Please take a moment to read the issue description below.

IMPORTANT: Please answer the questions on the basis of only the text shown here. 

{issue_description} 

## How well-specified is the issue text? 

Imagine that you are an experienced software engineer who has been instructed to create a PR that successfully resolves the above GitHub issue. You have full access to the codebase, and can see the issue description as it is above. But you are not able to ask for clarification and would need to work exclusively from this information. 

Is the issue description well-specified enough for a meaningful attempt at a solution? Please explain your reasoning. Include references to specific filenames, function/class names, or lines of code where relevant.

Please rank your response:
- 0: The issue is well-specified and it is clear what is required for a successful solution. 
- 1: There are some blanks to fill in about the issue, but there is a sensible interpretation of what is required for a successful solution. 
- 2: The issue is vague and there is room for ambiguity. It is unclear what a successful solution would look like.
- 3: It is almost impossible to understand what you are being asked to do without further information.

def q_2_1(gold_patch: str, test_patch: str):
  return f"""# Section 2 - Tests 

You will now consider the tests that will be used to check whether the issue is resolved. 

The Gold Patch is the solution for the issue given in the original PR, and the Test Patch contains any new tests that were added in that same PR to verify that the issue was resolved. 

Please carefully study the Test Patch shown below. 

{gold_patch} 
{test_patch} 

## False Negatives 
Given a new candidate solution, we intend to use the Test Patch to check whether the solution correctly resolves the issue. 

However, remember that these tests were written with a particular solution in mind (the Gold Patch) so they may be ill-suited for evaluating other valid solutions. We would like to know if the tests are correctly scoped to identify all reasonable solutions to the issue, or if the tests rely on narrow details that would unfairly penalize a new solution that is otherwise correct. 

In other words, our setup only works if the tests do not rely on any details that are not present in the issue description. We find that the most common problems occur when there are subtle discrepancies between the tests and the issue text, such as the tests relying on a new function, variable name, or error message that were introduced in the Gold Patch but is not mentioned or differs from the Issue Description. Please check carefully for such discrepancies, and remember that the engineer attempting this issue will not have access to the original PR or the tests. 

Note: You may go back to the previous sections to re-familiarize yourself with the issue whenever needed. 

Are the tests well-scoped such that all reasonable solutions to the issue should pass the tests? Please explain your reasoning.

Please rank your response:

You will consider the GitHub issue again and answer a final set of questions. You may navigate back to previous sections to see the issue and patches. 

## Difficulty 
We wish to understand how difficult this issue is to solve. 

How long would it take (for an experienced software engineer who had a few hours to familiarize themselves with the codebase) to understand the problem described in the GitHub issue, arrive at a solution and write the code for a solution? 

Note: If the issue text was previously too ambiguous to solve at all, you may assume that the problem has been clarified sufficiently such that the high-level requirements for the solution are clear (‚Äúwhat‚Äù), but the specifics about the solution are left to the engineer to figure out (‚Äúhow‚Äù). 

Please explain your reasoning.
