{"messages": ["content='You are a professional software engineer helping to annotate a dataset. \\n\\n\ud83d\udc4b Hello! \\n\\nWe have a dataset of GitHub issues from various open-source Python repositories. Each issue comes with a PR that successfully solves the issue described. Each PR consists of 2 parts: (1) code that resolves the issue (2) changes to the test files of the repository, which check whether the issue has been resolved. \\n\\nWe intend to use samples in this dataset as a benchmark for coding ability: For each sample, we give an engineer the issue text and ask them to write code to resolve the issue (without revealing the solution from the original PR). Then, we apply the test files from the original PR to their code and run the tests to check whether their solution passes. \\n\\nImportantly, this setup assumes that: \\n\\n- The issue description is sufficiently well-specified to understand what the problem is, and what the correct solution should look like. \\n- The tests are correctly scoped to the issue i.e. they correctly test for a solution exactly as described in the issue description, and do not test any other unrelated functionality. \\n\\nIn this task, you will help to check those assumptions and identify which issue + test samples are suitable for use in our benchmark. \\n\\n---\\nYou are now considering an issue from the astropy/astropy repository\\n\\nPlease familiarize yourself with the PR: \\n\\n---'", "content=\"# Section 1 - Issue Description\\n\\nPlease take a moment to read the issue description below.\\n\\nIMPORTANT: Please answer the questions on the basis of only the text shown here. \\n\\nModeling's `separability_matrix` does not compute separability correctly for nested CompoundModels\\nConsider the following model:\\r\\n\\r\\n```python\\r\\nfrom astropy.modeling import models as m\\r\\nfrom astropy.modeling.separable import separability_matrix\\r\\n\\r\\ncm = m.Linear1D(10) & m.Linear1D(5)\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nIt's separability matrix as you might expect is a diagonal:\\r\\n\\r\\n```python\\r\\n>>> separability_matrix(cm)\\r\\narray([[ True, False],\\r\\n       [False,  True]])\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nIf I make the model more complex:\\r\\n```python\\r\\n>>> separability_matrix(m.Pix2Sky_TAN() & m.Linear1D(10) & m.Linear1D(5))\\r\\narray([[ True,  True, False, False],\\r\\n       [ True,  True, False, False],\\r\\n       [False, False,  True, False],\\r\\n       [False, False, False,  True]])\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nThe output matrix is again, as expected, the outputs and inputs to the linear models are separable and independent of each other.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf however, I nest these compound models:\\r\\n```python\\r\\n>>> separability_matrix(m.Pix2Sky_TAN() & cm)\\r\\narray([[ True,  True, False, False],\\r\\n       [ True,  True, False, False],\\r\\n       [False, False,  True,  True],\\r\\n       [False, False,  True,  True]])\\r\\n```\\r\\nSuddenly the inputs and outputs are no longer separable?\\r\\n\\r\\nThis feels like a bug to me, but I might be missing something?\\n \\n\\n## How well-specified is the issue text? \\n\\nImagine that you are an experienced software engineer who has been instructed to create a PR that successfully resolves the above GitHub issue.
